== Description ==

This is the WooCommerce BuddyPress Integration xProfile Checkout extension. Integrate your BuddyPress xProfiles fields into your WooCommerce Checkout. You need the WC4BP plugin installed for the extension to work. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc4bp/" target="_blank">Get WC4BP now!</a>

What the plugin does:
Add your BuddyPress Member Profile Fields into the WooCommerce Checkout.
Manage your WooCommerce Checkout field and remove unwanted fields like "phone number" from the checkout form.

BuddyPress xProfile Fields Checkout Integration Options:

 - Add to Checkout
 - Add to order emails
 - Display field value on the order edit page

With this plugin you need no other WooCommerce Checkout manager. Use the BuddyPress User Field with many different field types to create individual checkout forms.

BuddyPress Default Field Types:

<h3><b>Multi Fields</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Checkboxes</li>
    <li>Drop Down Select Box</li>
    <li>Multi Select Box</li>
    <li>Radio Buttons</li>
</ul>

<h3>Single Fields</h3>

    <li>Multi-line Text Area</li>
    <li>Number</li>
    <li>Text Box</li>
    <li>URL</li>
</ul>

There are already great plugins to add more field types to BuddyPress
